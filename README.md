A C library for generating unlabeled free trees in constant amortized time using the WROM algorithm, with planned FFI support for Rust, Python, and other C-compatible languages.

The original Wright et al. (1986) paper presenting the algorithm can be found [here](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/ConstantTimeTrees.pdf), and a very good explanation written by Michael J. Dinneen is available [here](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/compsci720s1c/lectures/mjd/treenotes.pdf).
