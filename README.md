A C library for generating unlabeled free trees in constant amortized time using Wright et al.'s (1986) algorithm, with FFI support for Python, Julia, Rust, and other C-compatible languages.

The original paper describing the algorithm can be found [here](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/ConstantTimeTrees.pdf), and a very good explanation is available [here](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/compsci720s1c/lectures/mjd/treenotes.pdf).
